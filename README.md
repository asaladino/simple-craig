# Simple Craig (Never got an official name ðŸ˜©)

Prototype iOS app for posting items to Craig's List that was built with Matt D. Smith
[@mds](https://twitter.com/mds). This was the project where Matt created the popular [float label](https://twitter.com/floatlabel).

The project was scraped because we couldn't figure out a way to make it profitable.

The prototype is written in objective-c but should still compile. In the notes
folder you can see some design iterations and marketing concepts.
